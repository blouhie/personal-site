			Hi, I'm Julie, a student studying computer science at Oberlin College. I'm currently taking a gap year to explore my interests in creative and human-centered computing.
			
			Currently, I'm involved in projects addressing tech ethics at The YX Foundation and teaching kids and teenagers how to code at Juni Learning.
			
			Earlier in my gap year, I worked as an intern at SwerveLogic and created web and mobile apps as part of the NYC Web Development Fellowship. This summer, I'll be working on back-end services at Discovery.
